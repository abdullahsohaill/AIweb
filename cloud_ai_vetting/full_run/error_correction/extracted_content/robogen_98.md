## Abstract

We present RoboGen, a generative robotic agent that automatically learns diverse
robotic skills at scale via generative simulation. RoboGen leverages the latest
advancements in foundation and generative models. Instead of directly using or
adapting these models to produce policies or low-level actions, we advocate for
a generative scheme, which uses these models to automatically generate diversified tasks, scenes, and training supervisions, thereby scaling up robotic skill
learning with minimal human supervision. Our approach equips a robotic agent
with a self-guided propose-generate-learn cycle: the agent first proposes interesting tasks and skills to develop, and then generates corresponding simulation
environments by populating pertinent objects and assets with proper spatial configurations. Afterwards, the agent decomposes the proposed high-level task into
sub-tasks, selects the optimal learning approach (reinforcement learning, motion
planning, or trajectory optimization), generates required training supervision, and
then learns policies to acquire the proposed skill. Our work attempts to extract the
extensive and versatile knowledge embedded in large-scale models and transfer
them to the field of robotics. Our fully generative pipeline can be queried repeatedly, producing an endless stream of skill demonstrations associated with diverse
tasks and environments. RoboGen is simulated and rendered with Genesis , a multi-material multi-solver generative simulation engine for general-purpose robot learning.
