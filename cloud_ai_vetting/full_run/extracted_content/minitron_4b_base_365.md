## Model Overview

Minitron-4B-Base is a large language model (LLM) obtained by pruning Nemotron-4 15B; specifically, we prune model embedding size, number of attention heads, and MLP intermediate dimension. Following pruning, we perform continued training with distillation using 94 billion tokens to arrive at the final model; we use the continuous pre-training data corpus used in Nemotron-4 15B for this purpose.
Deriving the Minitron 8B and 4B models from the base 15B model using our approach requires up to 40x fewer training tokens per model compared to training from scratch; this results in compute cost savings of 1.8x for training the full model family (15B, 8B, and 4B). Minitron models exhibit up to a 16% improvement in MMLU scores compared to training from scratch, perform comparably to other community models such as Mistral 7B, Gemma 7B and Llama-3 8B, and outperform state-of-the-art compression techniques from the literature. Please refer to our arXiv paper for more details.
This model is for research and development only.

The following code provides an example of how to load the Minitron-4B-Base model and use it to perform text generation.

## Dataset & Training

Data Collection Method: Hybrid
Labeling Method: Not Applicable
Properties: The training corpus for Minitron-4B-Base consists of English and multilingual text, as well as code. Our sources cover a variety of document types such as: webpages, dialogue, articles, and other written materials. The corpus spans domains including legal, math, science, finance, and more. In our continued training set, we introduce a small portion of question-answering, and alignment style data to improve model performance.
Data Freshness: The pretraining data has a cutoff of June 2023.

## Inference

Engine: TensorRT-LLM
Test Hardware: NVIDIA A100
DType: Float16/BFloat16

## Limitations

The model was trained on data that contains toxic language, unsafe content, and societal biases originally crawled from the internet. Therefore, the model may amplify those biases and return toxic responses especially when prompted with toxic prompts. The model may generate answers that may be inaccurate, omit key information, or include irrelevant or redundant text producing socially unacceptable or undesirable text, even if the prompt itself does not include anything explicitly offensive.

## Ethical Considerations

NVIDIA believes Trustworthy AI is a shared responsibility and we have established policies and practices to enable development for a wide array of AI applications. When downloaded or used in accordance with our terms of service, developers should work with their internal model team to ensure this model meets requirements for the relevant industry and use case and addresses unforeseen product misuse.
